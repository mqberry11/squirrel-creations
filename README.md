# squirrel-creations

<p>Welcome to squirrel-creations! Here I share my web development projects as an aspiring full stack web developer.</p>

<p>To start, the first project I'm sharing is a <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub/space-tourism-multipage-website-r5_jnH0bC2">Frontend Mentor Space Tourist Website</a> challenge. This project recommends HTML, CSS and JS. Having no JS on my belt (yet) I am proud I completed the project running into only a handful of difficulties.</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep 'css.styles' organized</strong></li>
  <p>Halfway through the project I did a complete rehaul on the CSS code. Afterward navigating the css code was a breeze.</p>
  <li><strong>There are a many solutions!</strong></li>
  <p>To use two class attributes for one element I put a div inside a div. I doubt this will fall under best practices, but for now it works!</p>
  <li><strong>Solving problems quickly and well directly depends on the quality of your research questions and the resources you use.</strong></li>
  <p>At times finding answers to problems was challenging. The issue I found was not with the difficulty of the problem, but rather the issue was that I was asking the wrong question. As soon as I asked the right question the solution was simple.</p>
